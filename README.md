# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning Using CNN and RNN

Data Source: COCO (Common Objects in Context) image dataset https://cocodataset.org/#download

Language: Python (ver 3.10)

Platform: Jypter Notebook (You can install it using : https://jupyter.org/install) or Python IDLE, Terminal


Software Requirements: Mac OS or Windows 10

Summary:

In this project , we created and deployed a visual application to generate a caption for a given image and audio generation. We also test our model against other recent works in image captioning, by making use of CNN and RNN architecture and simplifying the overall design. In the future, we can optimize our model to perform in the real world with high quality audio.
